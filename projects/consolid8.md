One of the first projects I ever published was [Consolid8][wow-interface], an add-on for [World of Warcraft][]. It was designed to reduce the volume of low-importance messages flooding the chat window during group combat, by summarising them to the user after the event.

The add-on was [featured on WoWInterface][wowi-weekly-pick] when it launched, and has since been downloaded over 3,000 times. Unfortunately, I've been struggling to maintain it since I stopped playing the game years ago. As usual, the source code is [on GitHub][github-project].
