Sure, there are tonnes of encryption programs out there, but not many that run in your web browser. Of those, not many are that easy to use. So, a while ago I wrote Just Encrypt, a web page that encrypts or decrypts text in your web browser, with one mouse click.

[Open Just Encrypt](/just-encrypt/)
