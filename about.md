I'm a recent graduate in Computer Science from the [University of Southampton][] currently working at Google, with previous work experience at [CERN](/projects/invenio-mobile/) and [Snowflake Software](/projects/go-publisher-web-ui/). I have a wide variety of interests, including information security and user experience design. In my spare time I fence, [write fiction](/writing/), and contribute to [OpenStreetMap][].

While at University, I was an active volunteer for [Student Robotics][], a charity which runs an annual robotics competition for sixth-form students to promote engineering careers. I helped to run numerous events over four years, wrote tools for [software](/projects/sr-simulator/) and [hardware](/projects/sr-mci/) prototyping, and was briefly responsible for public relations.

The easiest way to contact me is [via email][email-captcha]. (If you want to encrypt your email, my PGP key is [on KeyBase](https://keybase.io/{{site.keybase_username}}).) You can find a number of my (sometimes abandoned) projects on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}).
