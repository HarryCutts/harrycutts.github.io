Creative writing is one of my hobbies. I'm working on a fantasy novel, and every now and then I write short stories, which can be found below. I've also written a number of things on [Typetrigger](#typetrigger).

Short stories
-------------

*[Night Train][]* — I wrote this piece (Short story? Collection of musings?) on a train at night at the end of summer 2011. It may be allegorical; but I'm not sure it's my place to decide.

*[Come Alive][]* — This short story was mainly inspired by the lyric from *We Found Love* by Rihanna and Calvin Harris.

*[Baščaršija Burns][]* — I wrote the first version of this short story as an English assignment, but the darkly fascinating siege of Sarajevo kept nagging in my mind until I rewrote it as an entry to the Wicked Young Writers competition in 2011.

*[Only in Dreams and Nightmares][]* — No comment.

*[Beneath the Sky][]* — An alternative myth, for an alternative world.

*[Yet it moves][]* — This short piece was inspired by [the Typetrigger prompt of the same name](http://typetrigger.com/trigger/yet%20it%20moves), but came to me a few months after I'd seen the prompt.

Typetrigger
