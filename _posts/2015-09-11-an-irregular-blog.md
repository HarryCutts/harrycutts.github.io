Hello! Welcome to the website. As you can see, it has a blog. Posts will likely be few and far between, but I hope you will find them edifying. Probable themes include programming, information security, user experience design, puns, and maybe the odd bit of politics or creative writing. For updates, you could subscribe to [the RSS feed][rss].
